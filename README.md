# stock_prediction_multimodel
 
The understanding of the stock market field is very
essential to Saudi 2030 vision, and in efforts to accomplish that, one of the KPIs to ensuring education
about that field is by optimizing the number of responsible investors in the market. However, there
has been too many stigmas for the public investors
that made them deflect to the real-estate business;
low-risk, low-reward; over a period of 30-40 years;
which yields 1-3 percent annually on average. Providing the means to educate individuals about the stock
market and financial information is very crucial. In
our approach we used a multi-model architecture to
encapsulate textual news and numerical financial information to better predict the stock price. Doing
so, will identify the leading variables towards defining what makes the price behave in the way it does.
With an LSTM-based model for time-series data, and
a Transformer-based model for textual data, the performance was adequate (68 percent accuracy for the
sentiment analysis model and 1.038 Riyal error in
the time-series model). Further exploration of feasibility of using Transformer-based architecture for
time-series is recommended.
